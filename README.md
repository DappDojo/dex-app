# Decentralized Exchange Project (DEX)

This project is the front-end of a Decentralized Exchange that integrates the smart contracts uploaded in [this github repository](https://github.com/DappDojo/Automated-Market-Maker) to build an Automated Market Maker. 

In this project we implemented the [Usedapp](https://usedapp.io/) framework for rapid React development.

The online Web3 application can be found in this [link](https://dappdojo-dex.netlify.app/)

> [!NOTE]
> This project was based on the work presented in this interesting [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y89q6T1r1Yg) by Javascript Mastery on YouTube. The original code can be found in this [github repository](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_web3_uniswap). To integrade our contracts we fixed the code and added some improvements.
